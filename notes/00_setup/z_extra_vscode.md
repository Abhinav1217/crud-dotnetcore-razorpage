**Note:**
- Recommended extensions for vs-code/code-oss is "C# with omnisharp" and  "vscode-solution-explorer"
- "vscode-solution-explorer" can conflict with the solution file generated with commands above. If this happens then delete the sln file and use the extension to generate a new sln file and add the project to it, This will create using more explicit commands that should reduce chances for id conflicts to happen. 
- another solution would be to restart the editor.
